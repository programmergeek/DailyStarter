This is a react app that retrives and displays data from a news and weather apis.

As of now the project is considered complete though there is a major bug left to fix, namely that you are unable to view news articles on any device apart from the host computer. I have a hypothesis as to why and how I could fix it which is making the api calls through a backend from which the react app will request the data from. I don't know how to create that backend though and I doubt I'm going to come back to this project when I do learn how.
